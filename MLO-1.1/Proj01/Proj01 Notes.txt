Proj01 Notes


The eight primitive data types are: 
byte, short, int, long, 
float, double, char, and boolean.

All data in Java falls into one of two categories: primitive data and objects. 

In Java, you usually represent a character in your program by surrounding it with apostrophe marks as shown below:

'A' (NOT QUOTATIONS ""!)

Chapter 8 https://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap08/ch08_06.html:

Integer types have no fractional part; floating point types have a fractional part. On paper, integers have no decimal point, and floating point types do. But in main memory, there are no decimal points.
Integer Primitive Data Types
Type	Size	Range
byte	8 bits	-128 to +127
short	16 bits	-32,768 to +32,767
int	32 bits	-2 billion to +2 billion (approximately)
long	64 bits	-9E18 to +9E18 (approximately)


Floating Point Primitive Data Types
Type	Size	Range
float	32 bits	-3.4E38 to +3.4E38
double	64 bits	-1.7E308 to 1.7E308

With a floating point type, positive exponent values mean that the decimal point should be shifted to the right . Negative exponent values mean that the decimal point should be shifted to the left .

PROJ01 ASSIGNMENT / PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS

Create a source code file named Proj01.java. Use that file to write a program named Proj01 to produce the output text shown below on the command-line screen. Encapsulate the file named Proj01.java in a zip file and submit it via Blackboard. Note that your class must also be named Proj01.

I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Replace this line with your name
Hello World



My name is Yolanda Gunter. I need to Create a source code file named Proj01.java. Use that file to write a program named Proj01 to produce the output text shown below on the command-line screen. Note that your class must also be named Proj01.
