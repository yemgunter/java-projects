<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp;make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class (named Proj11.java) for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>


<center>
<h2>Java Version Requirement</h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>

<div class="a">
<p>Proj11 Copyright 2020 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, the purpose of this assignment is to assess the student's
ability to write a program dealing with arrays in general
and ragged arrays in particular.</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Beginning with the file that you downloaded named <strong>Proj11.java</strong>, 
		create a new file named <strong>Proj11Runner.java</strong> to meet the specifications 
		given below.</p>
	  <p>Note that you must not modify code in the file named <strong>Proj11.java</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Be sure to display your name in the output as indicated.</p>
	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run the file 
	named <strong>Proj11.java</strong> <strong><em>with a command-line parameter 
	of 5</em></strong>, the program must display the text shown below on the 
	command line screen. More specifically, you must determine the length of each row in an
incoming 2D ragged array of type Object[][].You must populate the array elements with Integer 
count values from left to right, top to bottom
starting with the value 1 and ending with the sum
of the lengths of the rows.</p>

1 2
3 4 5 6 7

	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run the file 
	named <strong>Proj11.java</strong> <em> <strong>with a command-line 
	parameter of </strong></em>6, the program must display the text shown below 
	on the command line screen. You can use these two examples to test your 
	code.</p>

	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run the file 
	named <strong>Proj11.java</strong> <strong><em>without a command-line 
	parameter</em></strong>, the program must display text that is similar to, 
	but not necessarily the same as the text shown 
	below on the 
	command line screen. In this case, the numeric values are based on a random 
	number generator and will change from one run to the next.</p>
