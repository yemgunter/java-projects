<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp; make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for this assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>

If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.&nbsp;

<h2 class="auto-style1">Java Version Requirement</h2>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>
 

<div class="a"><p>Proj01 Copyright 2020 R.G.Baldwin</p>
		<p>The purpose of this assignment is to assess the student's
ability to write a complete but very simple Java program.</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Create a source code file named Proj01.java. Use that file to write a program named Proj01 to produce the output text shown below 
		on the command-line screen. Encapsulate the file named Proj01.java in a 
		zip file and submit it via 
		Blackboard. Note that your class must also be named Proj01.</p>
<pre>
I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Replace this line with your name
