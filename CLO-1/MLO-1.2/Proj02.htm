<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp; make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for this assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>

If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.&nbsp;

<h2 class="auto-style1">Java Version Requirement</h2>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>
 

<div class="a"><p>Proj02 Copyright 2020 R.G.Baldwin</p>
		<p>The purpose of this assignment is to assess the student's
ability to write a simple Java program involving command-line arguments.</p>
	<p>For reference, see 
	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/cmdLineArgs.html">The Javaâ„¢ Tutorials, Command-Line Arguments</a></p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Create a source code file named Proj02.java. Use that file to write a program named Proj02. 
		To begin, your program must produce the output text shown below on 
		the command-line screen. </p>
<pre>
I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Replace this line with your name
</pre>
<p>After that, your program must access, display, compute, and display the sum 
of an arbitrary number of integer command-line arguments. For example, if I were 
to use your program named Proj02.java and execute the following commands:</p>
	<pre>javac Proj02.java
java Proj02 1 2 3 4</pre>
	<p>your program would produce the following output on the command-line 
	screen:</p>
	<pre>I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Replace this line with your name

1
2
3
4
10</pre>
	<p>where 10 is the sum of the four integer command-line arguments.</p>
	<p> Encapsulate the file named Proj02.java in a zip file and submit it via Blackboard. Note that your class must also be named Proj02.</p>
